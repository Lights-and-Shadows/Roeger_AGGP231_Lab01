Home of my Lab01 for AG231

This is my repository for this first lab. In it, you'll find two Unity scenes, as well as a Videos folder containing the recordings we needed to do as part of the assignment. I will
admit, the videos could be of better quality, but I'm not used to recording myself. 

The first scene involves a simple mobile mini-game, the objective of which is to launch a ball at a set of blocks ahead of you. The main goal is to hit a red-colored block off the
platform. The ball does apply a small explosive force upon impact, but for the most part the shot needs to be a direct hit to fully register (may be fixed at a later date should I
choose to continue with this)

The second scene is a virtual recreation of those tilting toys with a silver ball inside. The ones where we had to navigate the ball through a maze to reach a hole inside. I put
a small twist on this concept though -- if you touch the walls, you lose. At least in theory. All you get is a simple text notification saying if you lost or not. As for the goal,
simply bring the ball to the green section of the maze. Also, your controls are a virtual joystick from the Joystick Pack courtesy of Fenerax Studios.
